# Data Structures and Algorithm Playground

This repo is a 😋playground to implement data structures and algorithms 👩🏻‍💻 using typescript.

## Getting Started

- Run this command:

```bash
 git clone https://github.com/Kathalysth/dsa-playground.git

```

- run `npm install`
  _Note that this project assumes you have typescript installed globally_
- if you don't have `Typescript` installed globally, run this command:

```bash
 npm install -g typescript

```

- create a `main.ts` file on your root dir.

- run `npm run dev` to watch for changes to the `main.ts` file

- create your feature branch from the `dev` branch:

```bash
 git checkout -b your_branch dev

```

- the branch naming convention is `username/learning_path/sub_path` eg:

```bash
 git checkout -b kathalysth/data-structure/linkedlist dev

```

There you have it 🥳, play around with implementing any data structure or algorithms 🧑🏻‍🚀.
